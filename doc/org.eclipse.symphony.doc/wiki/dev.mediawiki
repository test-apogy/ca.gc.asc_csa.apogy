== Symphony Architecture ==

* Based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF);
* A basic custom framework (''EMFInvocator'') defines the ''Type'', ''Variable'', ''Context'', ''Operation Call'', and ''Operation Call Result'' concepts;
* Symphony specializes a few concepts defined in ''EMFInvocator'' and adds new ones: 3D representation, ''Assembly Links'', ''Connection Points'' and ''Data Product'' geo-referencing; 

[[File:../resources/dev/symphony_arch.svg|frame]]

=== Type Interface Modeling ===

* Recall, that a ''System'' is a specialized ''Type'', which's use forms much of the backbone of Symphony.
* The interface of the ''System'' is modeled in EMF (e.g. via Xcore) and ends up being transformed into an EClass
* The commands of the ''System'' directly correspond the modeled system's operations.
* The command's parameters and return value types correspond to ''EClasses'', ''EEnumerations'', and other built-in types (e.g. ''boolean'', ''float'', ''int'', etc.)
* The states (telemetry) of the ''System'' directly corresponds to the modeled system's attributes.
* The states's types of the ''System'' also correspond to ''EClasses'', ''EEnumerations'', and other built-in types.
* The most important fact of the ''System'' is '''while there is only one interface, there many be any number of possible implementations.''' 

=== Variable Initialization ===

<ul>
	<li> ''Variable'' initialization is done through the ''InvocatorDelegate'' (which is specialized in Symphony):</li>
	<ol>
		<li> Gets the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' associated with the ''Variable'';</li>
		<li> Instantiate the ''System'';</li>
		<li> Copies its associated topology and sets it in the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'';</li>
		<li> For each ''TypeMember'':</li>
		<ol type="i">
			<li> Gets the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' associated with the ''Variable'';</li>
			<li> Instantiate the ''System'';</li>
			<li> Copies its associated topology and sets in the appropriate ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'';</li>
			<li> Attaches the topology to the parent's ''Connection Point'';</li>
			<li> Recurse for each ''TypeMember'' of the current ''TypeMember''.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
</ul>

=== Operation Call Invocation ===

* Method invocation is done through EMF reflection;
* Actual invocation done through the invocator delegate, which in turn, delegates part of it to the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter''.

[[File:../resources/dev/operation_call_invocation.svg]]

== Symphonyzing ==

=== Definition ===

'''''Symphonyzing''''': ''The process of creating EMF models of a System to expose its interface to Symphony.''

Some of what you get in return:
* Generic support for command call invocation and documentation;
* Generic support for telemetry (display, recording and playback);
* Command call result tracking (time, position, command parameters);
* 3D ''System'' and ''Environment'' representation.

=== High-Level Steps ===

Defining a Symphony ''System'' involves 3 steps:
# Defining the ''System'' in EMF;
# Creating the Symphony plugin;
# Creating the Symphony System Model (*.ss).

=== Guidelines ===

Symphonizing Guidelines:
# Keep the ''System'' EMF model seperate from Symphony; this provides modularity and your system can be used before your Symphony plugin is done!
# Attributes are '''NEVER''' changed directly by an operator; they are considered states that are changed in response to command calls and interaction with the environment.
# Commands are used to change the settings of a ''System'' (e.g. operating mode, limits, etc.) as well as to to command actions. However, commands are '''NOT''' used to get the current status of the System; attributes are used instead to accomplish this. 

==== Suggested Plugin Nomenclature ====

|}
   
=== Step 1. Defining The System In EMF ===

==== Creating An EMF Model Of The System ====

<ol>
	<li> Create an Xcore Project named '''<org_prefix>.<system_name>''', where '''<org_prefix>''' is a placeholder for a prefix appropriate for your organization;</li>
	<li> Rename the '''''/src-gen''''' folder to '''''/src-generated''''';</li>
	<li> Create your Xcore model in the '''''/model''''' folder;</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> Ensure that you change the '''''modelDirectory''''' @GenModel directive to point to the ''<org_prefix>.<system_name>'''''''/src-generated''''' folder;</li>
		<li> Ensure that you change the '''''editDirectory''''' @GenModel directive to point to the ''<org_prefix>.<system_name>.edit'''''''/src-generated/''''' folder;</li>
	</ol>
	<li> Define your ''System'' classes;</li>
	<li> Implement the methods as required;</li>
	<ul>
		<li> Ensure that you either remove the methods' @generated annotations or change them to @generated_NOT; otherwise, your changes will be overwritten the next time the Xcore compiler runs!</li>
	</ul>
	<li> Override getters for attributes that have a cardinality of [1] (i.e. are required)</li>
	<li> You are done!</li>
</ol>

==== Recommended Class Hierarchy ====

[[File:../resources/dev/recommended_class_hierarchy.svg]]

<ol>
	<li> Define an abstract class (''A'') representing your ''System''; this includes:</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> Defining the class itself;</li>
		<li> Defining all the class attributes and their classes;</li>
		<li> Defining all methods as well as their parameters and return values; this may involve specifying additional classes.</li>
	</ol> 
	<li> Define a concrete ''AStub'' class that extends ''A''.  The methods for this implementation do nothing.  This class can be used in Symphony when playing data back.</li>
	<li> Define a concrete ''ASimulated'' class that extends ''A''. This implementation provides a simulated ''A'' for Symphony.</li>
	<li> Define a concrete ''AReal'' class that extends ''A''.  This implementation provides an interface to the real (physical) system.</li>
</ol>

=== Step 2. Creating the Symphony plugin ===

==== Definition ====

The '''Symphony plugin''' is an EMF (typically Xcore) plugin, which contains the required meta-model to specify the ''System'''s interface with Symphony.

It typically defines a specialization of ''SymphonyInitializationData''; this allows Symphony to be able to both capture as well as restore the specific state of the ''System'', which is useful in a variety of circumstances.  The ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' is also typically subclassed, allowing one to customize the invocation of the ''System'''s operations.     

==== The Four Steps to making a Symphony Plugin ====

Creating the Symphony plugin involves four (4) steps:
# Creating the plugin;
# Creating an Xcore model;
# Defining a sub-class of ''SymphonyInitializationData'';
# Defining a sub-class of ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter''.

===== i. Creating the Symphony Plugin Itself =====
TODO!

===== ii. Creating a Xcore (.xcore) Model =====
TODO!

===== iii. Defining a Subclass of <i>SymphonyInitializationData</i> =====

The ''SymphonyInitializationData'' class only includes the pose of your ''System'' in the ''Worksite'' frame.

Your specialized ''SymphonyInitializationData'':
* Defines the required initialization data for your ''System''.
* Symphony persists the data for you.
* Symphony delegates to your custom ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' sub-class, the responsibility to create, populate and apply the data; 

====== Rules & Guidelines ======

* All atttributes in your specialized SymphonyInitializationData must be:
** Contained in the ''SymphonyInitializationData'' (or marked as '''transient''');
** Serializable (or have the necessary methods implemented correctly in your Symphony plugin Factory implementation class);
* Should contain all of the data required to bring your ''System'' back to a given state (e.g. modes, actuators, position, etc.)

===== iv. Defining a Subclass of <i>SymphonySystemApiAdapter</i> =====

Providing a specialized ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'':
* Allows for the specialization of ''OperationCallPositionResult''';
* Enables the customized calculation of the result position matrix for each specific ''Operation Call'';
* Provides support for custom ''InitializationData'' creation, collection and application;
* Grants access to the ''Symphony Environment'' (which includes the worksite, sky, etc.) 

====== Localization ======

* Symphony does '''NOT''' assume anything about the ''System'''s ''Interface Class'' (apart from it being an EClass), so there is no way for Symphony to know where to get the pose information about your ''System''.

* There are two ways to implement this:
*# Through the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'':
*#* Typically done by using an adapter on the system to figure out when the pose changes and call the '''setPoseTransform(Matrix4x4)''' method of the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter;
*#** The ''MobilePlatform'' and ''Lander'' examples use this method;
*# Have your System implement ''PoseProvider'' (''org.eclipse.symphony.core.PoseProvider''): The ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' will handle it for you. 

====== Rules & Guidelines ======

* Your specialized ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' is:
** '''NOT PERSISTED''': it is instantiated every time you call ''Reset Instances'';
** Not shared between instances of your System;
* While your specialized ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' can depend on your ''System'''s EMF model, the opposite is not true (would lead to a dependency cycle);
* Just override the methods you need: the ''SymphonySystemApiAdapter'' provides adequate default implementation for all methods

====== <i>SymphonySystemApiAdapter</i> Methods ======

{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
! Method
! Description
! Default Implementation
! Override must call super
|-
| void '''init'''(''Environment'', ''Type'', ''EObject'')
| Initialize the adapter with the ''Environment'', ''Type'', and the System instance (''EObject'').
| Initialize the ''Environment'', ''Type'', and ''EObject'' (instance) of the adapter.
| style="text-align:center;" | Yes
|-
| void '''apply'''(''AbstractInitializationData'')

| Collects the System's required initialization and stores in the ''AbstractInitializationData'' instance provided.
| Collects the pose of the System relative to the worksite.
| style="text-align:center;" | Yes
|-
| ''OperationCallResult'' '''createResult'''(''OperationCall'')
| Must create an ''OperationCallPositionedResult'' that will be used to store the result of invoking the specified command.

| style="text-align:center;" | No
|-
| ''Matrix4x4'' '''createResultMatrix'''(''OperationCall'')
| Creates the 4-by-4 matrix (''Matrix4x4'') that defines the pose of the specified result relative to the System's origin.
| Return an instance of ''Matrix4x4'' that is the identity matrix.
| style="text-align:center;" | No
|}

=== Step 3. Creating the <i>Symphony System Model</i> (*.ss) file ===

==== Definition ====

Recall that the ''Symphony System'':

* Is the "LEGO block" of Symphony;
* A '''''System''''' is a specialization of ''Type'';
* Adds functions to assemble systems together through ''Connection Points'' and ''Assembly Links'';
* Provdes a 3D representation of the System.

==== The Six Steps to make a <i>Symphony System Model</i> ====

Creating a ''Symphony System Model'' (*.ss file) involves:
<ol>
	<li> Defining the ''Topology Root'';</li>
	<li> Defining the ''Bindings'';</li>
	<li> Defining the ''Connection Points'';</li>
</ol>

Additionally, for Composite ''Systems'':

<ol start="4">
	<li> Defining ''Type Members'';</li>
	<li> Defining ''Assembly Links'';</li>
</ol>

Finally:

<ol start="6">
	<li> Registering your ''Symphony System'';</li>
</ol>

===== i. Defining the <i>Topology Root</i> =====

The steps to fully defining the ''Symphony System'''s topology are:
# Creating a root node (e.g ''AggregateGroupNode'')
# Assembly a hierarchy of transforms (e.g ''TransformNode'', ''RotationNode'', ''PositionNode'') to defined how parts are relative in position to each other and allow support for animation;
# Add nodes representing geometries (e.g ''URLNode'');
# Add other specialized nodes (e.g. ''Wheel'', ''Thruster'', ''RectangularFrustrumFieldOfView'', etc.)

====== Topology Guidelines ======

* Be sure to specify the '''Node Id''' for every node.  The recommended naming pattern should include the name of the ''System'' as a prefix (e.g. a prefix like "'''<SYSTEM_NAME>_SYM_SYS'''"); 
* For ''TransformNodes'' that are intended to be used to affect DOF, include '''JOINT''' in the '''Node Id''';
* Fill in the description with a meaningful explanation (it aids in clarity and long-term maintenance.);
* Defining a joint (either revolution or linear) is typically done using a pair of ''TransformNodes'':
** The first ''TransformNode'' defines where the joint is and is not intended to change;
** The second ''TransformNode'' (the one with its '''Node Id''' containing '''JOINT''') is the one that will affect the motion;
* A geometry file (e.g. ''CAD'') is needed to specify each part that makes up an articulated system.  For example:
** One file for the rover chassis, one for the wheel(s);
** One for the base of a PTU Camera, one for the tilt fork and one for the camera;

An example of the general structure given by these guidelines is:

[[File:../resources/dev/topology_guidelines_example.svg]]

===== ii. Defining the Bindings =====

Topology bindings are what Symphony uses to relate selected attributes in the ''System'''s ''Interface Class'' to behaviours of the topology.  This allows, for example:
* Binding the position of a certain ''TransformNode'' to a linear position atribute in the System's ''Interface Class'';
* Binding the vertical and horizontal angles of a FOV in the topology to the FOV of a camera attribute in the System's ''Interface Class''  

Defining the bindings required the following steps:
# Populating the ''Feature Roots List''
# Populating the ''Bindings List''

====== Populating the <i>Feature Roots List</i> ======

* The ''Feature Roots List'' is where all of the attributes of the ''System'''s ''Interface Class'' that will be used in bindings are specified
* The list of available attributes is automatically populated, based on the ''System'''s specified ''Interface Class''.
* Populating the ''Feature Roots List'' involves the following:
*# Under ''Feature Roots List'', create a new ''Tree Root Node'';
*# Set the ''Source Class'' of the ''Tree Root Node'' to the same class as the ''Interface Class'' of the ''Symphony System'';
*# Add the required child child under the ''Tree Root Node'' and its sub-nodes to specify the required attributes for the bindings.

====== Populating the <i>Bindings List</i> ======

* Populating the ''Binding List'' involves:
*# Under ''Binding List'', create a new ''Binding'' of the required type;
*#* It is recommended that the name of all binding elements include '''BIND''' 
*# Set the attributes of the newly created ''Binding''

====== Bindings Currently Available in Symphony ======

The bindings currently available for generic topology ''Nodes'' are:

{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
! Binding

! Function
|- 
| '''''ThrusterBinding'''''
| ''Thruster''
| Maps the values of a ''Thruster'' to another ''Thruster'' attribute.
|}

===== iii. Defining the <i>Connection Points</i> =====

* Recall that, ''Connection Points'' are metaphorical hooks where sub-''Systems'' can be attached.
* A ''Connection Point'' typically defines a physical location where a ''System'' might expect other sub-''Systems'' to be assembled. 
* Populating the ''Connections Points List'' involves the following:
*# Under the ''Connection Points List'', create a new ''Connection Point'';
*# Set the name and description of the ''Connection Point''; 
*#* It is recommended that the name of the ''Connection Point'' include '''CONNECT''';
*# Set the ''Node'' of the ''Connection Point''.

===== iv. Defining <i>Type Members</i> (Only for Composite <i>Systems</i>) =====

TODO!

===== v. Defining <i>Assembly Links</i> (Only for Composite <i>Systems</i>) =====

TODO!

===== vi. Registering your <i>Symphony System Model</i> with Symphony =====

In order for Symphony to be made aware of your ''Symphony System Model'', your model must be registered.
Here are the steps to do so:

# Open the '''MANIFEST.MF''' of the the plugin where your ''Symphony System Model'' is defined;
# In the ''Extensions'' tab, click ''Add...''
# Ensure the "''Show only the extension points from the required plug-ins''" checkbox is '''NOT''' checked.
# Select the '''org.eclipse.symphony.core.invocator.typeContributor''' extension point;
# Click ''Finish''
# Select the newly added extension and then click on ''Browse'' for the '''URI''' field;
# Browse to your ''Symphony System Model'' (*.ss) file and click ''OK'';
# Save the '''MANIFEST.MF'''

|}

==== Units Management ====

* Recall, that an attribute's units (e.g. radians, metres, seconds, etc.) can be specified by using the '''csa_units="..."''' directive in the @GenModel annotations of one's xcore models.
* This information can then be used to perform those ''Native Units'' to a ''Different Display'' unit (e.g. degrees <-> radians) 
* In order to have the ''Properties View'' correctly manage attributes for which units have been defined:
** Need to modify the generated method in the generated ''ItemProvider'' for the EClass (found in the respective .edit plugin):
**# Add a dependency to org.eclipse.symphony.common.emf.ui;
**# Replace the '''createItemPropertyDescriptor()''' call with '''new ''AbstractUnitItemPropertyDescriptor''''';
**# Mark the method as '''@generated_NOT''' to prevent your work from being overwritten;

For a concrete example, the following block of code:

 /**
  * This adds a property descriptor to the Current Pan Angle feature
  * @generated
  */

 protected void addCurrentPanAnglePropertyDescriptor(Object object)
 {
 	itemPropertyDescriptor.add
 		('''createItemPropertyDescriptor'''
 			(((ComposableAdapterFactory) adapterFactory).getRootAdapterFactory(),
 			 getResourceLocator(),
 			 ...
 }

should become:

 /**
  * This adds a property descriptor to the Current Pan Angle feature
  * @generated<b>_NOT</b>
  */

 protected void addCurrentPanAnglePropertyDescriptor(Object object)
 {
 	itemPropertyDescriptor.add
 		(<b>new AbstractUnitItemPropertyDescriptor</b>
 			(((ComposableAdapterFactory) adapterFactory).getRootAdapterFactory(),
 			 getResourceLocator(),
 			 ...
 }
