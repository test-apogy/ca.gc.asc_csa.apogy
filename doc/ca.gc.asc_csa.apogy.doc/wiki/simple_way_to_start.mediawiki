__TOC__

The examples are a simple way to get started interacting with Apogy and seeing what it can do.  The simplest way to get started is to use one of the ''Registered Apogy Projects''. Each of these include an Apogy Session that is ready to use in a few clicks.

Lets use the ''Rover'' example system to do that. Here is the step by step procedure to get started:

= Importing the <i>Rover Example</i> Session =

<ol>
	<li> Ensure the ''Project Explorer'' view is opened </li>
	<li> Right-click on the ''Project Explorer'' and select "''New > Project...''";</li>
	<li> Select "''Apogy > New Apogy Project''" and click "''Next >''";</li>
	<li> In the wizard that appears:</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> Enter '''MyFirstApogyProject''' for the name of the new project;</li>
		<ul>
			<li> Ensure that the "'''Import Registered Apogy Project'''" check box is '''checked''';</li>
		</ul>
		[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_import_registered_project.png|640x512px]]		
		<li> Click "''Next >''";</li>
		<li> In the list of registered Apogy Project, select '''Rover Example''';</li>		
		[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_import_rover_example.png|640x512px]]	
		<li> Click "''Finish''";</li>
	</ol>
	<li> The project is now created. The session editor should now be opened and the content of the  session.sym displayed and should look like this:</li>
	[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_in_session_editor.png|640x512px]]
</ol>

= Configuring the Views =

In order to view the Rover, a few views are necessary. Here are the steps to configure them:

<ol>
	<li> Ensure the ''Properties'' view is opened. </li>
	<li> Open the ''Apogy 3D Viewer'' by selecting in the menu bar ''Window > Show View > Other.. > Apogy Core > Apogy 3D Viewer'' and press ''OK'';</li>	
	<li> The Apogy 3D viewer should now be opened (this can take a few seconds) and should look like this:</li>

</ol>

= Initializing and Using the Rover =

You are now ready to initialize the rover and start issuing it commands. Here are the steps to do that:

<ol>
	<li> In the session editor, navigate down the tree to the ''Apogy Environment'' (see screen shot below); </li>
	[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_navigating_to_apogy_environment.png|640x512px]]	
	<li> Select "''Apogy Environment''" and right-click, this will bring up a menu like this:</li>
	[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_reset_instances.png|640x512px]]	
	<li>Select "''Apogy > Reset Instances''". This will start the rover instanciation and the rover geometry will appear in the Apogy 3D Viewer: </li>
	[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_rover_instanciated.png|640x512px]]	
	<li> The rover is now ready to accept commands. Lets start by issuing the required commands to initialize it :</li>
	<ol type="i">
		<li> In the session editor, navigate down the tree to ''Programs'' then to ''Operation Calls Setup'' (see screenshot below). This is a container of Operation Calls (lists of Operation Call);</li>
		[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_navigating_to_operation_calls.png|640x512px]]			
		<li> Select the "''Operation Calls Setup''" operation call list and right-click, this will bring up a menu like this: ;</li>
		[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_invoke_init.png|640x512px]]		
		<li>Select "''Apogy > Invoke''". This will invoke all the commands listed inside the "''Operation Calls Setup''" on the rover, on after the other. The rover is then fully initialized. Lets now move it around.</li>
		<li> Navigate to the ''Operation Calls Navigate'', expand the list and select the "''Change Angular Velocity Only''" and invoke it using the same procedure (see below). The rover should now start to turn on itself at a rate of 10.0 &deg;/s.</li>
		[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_invoke_change_angular_velocity_only.png|640x512px]]	
				
		<li> Select "''Change Angular Velocity Only''" and invoke it using the same procedure. The rover should now start move forward at 0.5 m/s and turn at the same time, thus doing an arc turn.</li>		
		
	</ol>
</ol>

Lets modify the angular velocity of the rover to make the arc turn wider. In order to do so, we will change the "''angularVelocity"'' parameter of the "''Change Angular Velocity Only''" command. Here is how to do it:
<ol>
			<li> Select "''Change Angular Velocity Only''" and expand it down to the "''angularVelocity''" parameter (see screenshot below). </li>
			[[File:../resources/tutorials/rover_example_changing_angular_vel.png|640x512px]]
			<li> Select the "''angularVelocity''" parameter, then in the Properties view, select the "''Advanced''" tab. The Properties view should now show it and its current value (10.0 &deg;/s)</li>
			<li> In the Properties view, set the "''angularVelocity''" parameter value to 2.0 &deg;/s</li>
			<li> Invoke "''Change Angular Velocity Only''". This will command the current angular velocity without changing the linear one, making the rover move along a wider arc.</li>
</ol>

If you want the rover to stop, just invoke "''Stop''". This command will set both linear and angular velocity to zero.
