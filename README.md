**Apogy** is a multi-mission operations and planning software framework. **Apogy** uses EMF models to define the systems being controlled, the environment in which these systems are operated, the operations being carried out and the corresponding data produced during operations.

**Apogy** exploits the Eclipse platform and modern model based software development tools and techniques such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). This approach inherently promotes a highly modular and extendable software architecture that allows customization of functionalities with little effort. For each system to be controlled, **Apogy** provides a single model that defines: command, telemetry, engineering units, limits, documentation, 3D topology and 3D representation. System assemblies can then be created from these models to build different spacecraft and instrument configurations. The mission target environment can also be defined that includes maps (2D and 3D), locations, annotations as well as location specific and time dependent model of the sky (sun, moon and stars). Teleoperation is supported through flexible hand controller mapping, camera displays with customizable overlays and image filtering, real-time map displays (2D and 3D). **Apogy** maintains rigorously contexts information such as the command and parameter used to generate the plan execution product, timing information and localization. **Apogy** then make use of these informations to provide the overall context of the operations and their products to the engineers and scientists. In the last years, **Apogy** has been used in multiple deployments involving different types of rovers equipped with various sensors and instruments all operated through **Apogy**.

The framework provides basic operational plan editors that allow, through context switching, the tests and execution of plans in a seamless process. The Canadian Space Agency is in the process to transfer the **Apogy** codebase to Eclipse.
